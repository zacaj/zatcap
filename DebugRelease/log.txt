@SwooshyCueb I have no idea what state it's in, because I'm the only user, so I haven't kept the instuctions up to date (556661861299396608,)

@delta_vee I am, but it shouldn't matter?  My local copy has commits I want to push, and github has commits that I already made locally... (556664635475394560,)
Tweet sent successfully: 
@delta_vee ...manually, so they're useless and I'd just like to remove the last few on github so then I can push my local copy (556664635475394560,)
Tweet sent successfully: 
@delta_vee and 'move your local repo, clone the remote down, change it, and re up it, then push your old local' is not a solution (556664635475394560,)
Tweet sent successfully: 
@delta_vee maybe I should just force push? (556664635475394560,)
Tweet sent successfully: 
@delta_vee I know it's 'bad' but is there a reason I should care (556665468803887104,)
